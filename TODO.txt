- currently the thousands and decimal marks can be specified by the
  caller but are not inherently bound to a currency code, even though
  users of any given currency have an official format in which to display
  amounts.  it would be great if by specifying the currency, the proper
  marks were figured out
- review all currency symbols via wikipedia for position, spacing and sign
- add support for all currencies not currently in map
